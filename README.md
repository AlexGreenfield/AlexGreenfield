## Hello there!! ðŸ‘‹

Greetings! I'm Alex, a tech journalist who recently started his journey into programming. 

At the moment I'm studying at 42 Madrid campus, getting the hang of computer programming and making my first steps on C language. This Github page is a way to keep track of my progress in the campus, but I hope it helps other students!!
